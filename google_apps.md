#Google Apps accounts for contributors

Here's a few things to know about Google apps at Enspiral.

* They cost $5USD per month, per user. That's about 84 NZD per year. We've just recently agreed that users should pay for their accounts in [this Loomio](https://www.loomio.org/d/9kpIaK6W/comment/1132628/)
* They allow you to have an email address but aren't neccesary to interact with Enspiral people.
* Any contributor can request a Google Apps account, if they need it to represent Enspiral.
