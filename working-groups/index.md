# Working groups

*Warning: this is experimental territory. Expect it to be updated frequently.*

Active working groups:

* Catalysts: [Guide]() | [Slack](https://enspiral.slack.com/messages/wg-catalysts/)
* Ambassadors
* Brand Working Group
* Financial Working Group
* Well Working Group

Anyone can start a working group. Often a working group will be initiated by someone with high context but low capacity for action (e.g. directors or catalysts), and then they'll recruit contributors with more capacity.

Standard operating procedure for working groups:

* **have a name**, e.g. "Financial Working Group"
* **have a scope**, e.g. "Take the Board's recommendations about Foundation finances and turn them into decisions."
* **membership**: a named list of people who are in, plus a way for people to join, if appropriate
* a **Slack channel** using the `wg-` naming convention, e.g. #wg-financial (and optionally, a private Slack channel #wg-financial-private)
* **reporting**: post updates in the public Slack channel and in the newsletter
* **decision making**: it's common for working groups to involve people in deliberations on Loomio. Tagging Loomio threads with the `wg-` label will make them easier to find.
* **task tracking**: we use the Improvements board for task tracking. Read the [Improvements Guide](./guides/improvements.md) and talk to Rich if you'd like hands-on support. E.g. [here are the tickets](https://waffle.io/enspiral/improvements?label=WG-financial) for the Financial Working Group (labeled wg-financial).
* **rhythm**: align to the two-weekly sprint rhythm set by the Catalysts (e.g, sprint 15 starts on Monday Oct 31.) The sprint rhythm corresponds to the "milestones" on the Improvements board. All active tasks on the Improvements board have a Milestone, i.e. which sprint to we expect to finish the work. Here's the tickets for [Sprint 15](https://waffle.io/enspiral/improvements?milestone=sprint-15)

You can take as much of this structure as is useful!
