## How to get paid for a Cobudget Bucket

Once you've proposed a Bucket and it gets Funded (Woohoo! High-five!!), at the end of the funding round you will be contacted by email with a request to send an invoice to Enspiral Foundation via foundation@enspiral.com.

In your invoice, be sure to include:
* the total amount for the bucket (remember, the amounts in Cobudget are GST-exclusive)
* bucket name and URL
* a clear indication of whether GST is included in your invoice
* bank account number
