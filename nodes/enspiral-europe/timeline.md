*Subjective note from the author:* Documenting the emergence of Enspiral Europe Node sent me down a rabbit hole of research, digging through Loomio, Slack, various documents, and old newsletters, looking for the most important pieces of our story and weaving different perspectives together.

While everything is context dependent and your node-building journey will most likely look different to ours, there seem to be a few underlying principles at play that lay at the foundation of the entire Enspiral ecosystem:

- **People before projects.** Invest the energy in nurturing relationships and creating a shared sense of belonging, and collaborations will naturally follow.   
- **In-Real-Life Gatherings play a critical role in nurturing relationships.** Digital spaces serve well as connecting spaces in between IRL gatherings, but can‚Äôt replace them.
- Embrace that **nurturing relationships takes time** and the beginnings can feel slow. Installing a regular rhythm (in our case having a gathering twice a year) is the most effective way to grow.  

At the end of the day, committing to Enspiral, means committing to meeting together and nurturing relationships over a long period of time. **Think of Enspiral as an infinite game - with no win-condition, and the objective to keep on playing together.**

A node is a container making it easier for people with shared geographical location and/or interests to connect and grow together, while benefiting the entire Enspiral ecosystem.

Let‚Äôs play!

Back in 2020, a post appeared on Enspiral Loomio:

Fast forward to September 2022, and you'll see another post, this time giving the official thumbs up from the Enspiral Board for Enspiral Europe - the very first Node within Enspiral.

IMAGE

January 2023 marks the beginning of collaborations emerging from within the node. It took us three years to get to this point, and that‚Äôs okay - **we are growing at the speed of trust**.

Here's a timeline of building Enspiral Europe Node.

## The Origins

Enspiral Europe emerged from addressing multiple needs:

-   Weaving Belonging between Enspiralites based in Europe, without having to fly to NZ   
-   Moving the energy in Enspiral, which felt quite stagnated for some time
-   Creating an ‚ÄúEnspiraly Thing‚Äù in Europe, which with time would have real impact in the region, similar to the impact Enspiral has in NZ

It is worth noting, that at the time Enspiral functioned as a network revolving around NZ gravity centre, and starting a local node would have significant governance implications, requiring attention and energy from multiple members. Nonetheless, the **value of Enspiral‚Äôs lineage** outweighed the possibility of starting a ‚Äúnew thing‚Äù from scratch.¬†

‚≠êÔ∏è 22 January 2020: **Enspiral Europe Seed WG ([Loomio](https://www.loomio.com/d/PfASDzWV/update-on-enspiral-europe-)) brings together people working on advancing Enspiral energy in Europe, and sets a 18-months roadmap:**

-   Form Europe Seed WG [handbook: formal working group](https://handbook.enspiral.com/agreements/working_groups#formal))   
-   Setup [Loomio subgoup](https://www.loomio.com/enspiral-europe/)
-   Identify Europe-based contributors
-   Host regular monthly call (see: [Invitation](https://www.loomio.com/d/cU45gHDM/let-s-kickstart-this-eu-energy-monthly-open-call))
-   Explore governance (see: [Original conversation on Loomio exploring memberships, agreements, finances etc.](https://www.loomio.com/d/GFWxuoa7/governance-implications-of-enspiral-europe)
-   Call a pod round (see: [Call for European Pods](https://www.loomio.com/d/cmnHCQFj/call-for-european-pods)  
-   Host two gatherings - summer 2020 and winter 2021

The Seed WG also communicates the potential governance implications of the European experiment for the entire network ([Loomio](https://www.loomio.com/d/GFWxuoa7/governance-implications-of-enspiral-europe))

IMAGE

Great plan indeed. And then, Covid happened.

## Growing at the Speed of Trust

In April 2020, the first round of pods resulted in forming 1 pod (see: [Call For European Pods](https://www.loomio.com/d/cmnHCQFj/call-for-european-pods)). We‚Äôre also increasing the rhythm on Enspiral Europe calls to bi-weekly (see: [EU Open Calls](https://www.loomio.com/d/XkfSUJZc/eu-open-calls))

With Covid regulations making it impossible to gather in-person as originally envisioned, the energy of the Seed WG was channelled into hosting a virtual gathering.

‚≠êÔ∏è 24-26 2020 September: **Cultivating Enspiral Europe - Virtual Gathering**

IMAGE

The gathering brought together 17 participants, and resulted in catalysing the energy in Europe on numerous fronts:

- **‚ÄúSprouting" the Seed WG into two working groups: Governance (aka Sprout üå±) and Connection ([Loomio](https://www.loomio.com/d/TMHSfdm6/working-groups-))**
- In the following months, WG Sprout focused on **upgrading the onboarding process**, including onboarding new Enspiralites in cohorts ([Loomio](https://www.loomio.com/d/9LlKNDbm/-wg-europe-sprout-updates-thread)),
- The WG Connection focused on Enspiral Europe Calls, starting with a bi-weekly rhythm for **Enspiral Connection Calls + Enspiral-Focused Call** (one out of four sessions). See: [Original Post on Loomio](https://www.loomio.com/d/gHua7Ys4/enspiral-europe-calls-post-summerfest-2020-) and [updates on Loomio](https://www.loomio.com/d/3lLgjFTx/connection-wg-how-we-re-gonna-connect). The calls provided a key digital connection rhythm for Enspiral Europe and continue until today.
- **Calling a round of pods** ([Loomio](https://www.loomio.com/d/0ZqLu4lK/enspiral-eu-pods-formation-)), including a pod for new Enspiralites, which could be considered another experiment into onboarding into the network.

IMAGE

- **Probing into possible collaborations between members**, which brought some interest, but no tangible projects emerged at this point ([Loomio](https://www.loomio.com/d/Ub4FV3t5/projects-and-collaborations)). We probed again in January 2021, this time with very little engagement ([Loomio](https://www.loomio.com/d/5KkNi6a9/our-interests-and-potential-future-focuses-for-work-and-projects)). That's possibly due to the European Node being still in the "people" phase (which precedes "projects" phase).

IMAGE

In March 2021 we introduced **monthly check-ins on** [Loomio](https://www.loomio.com/d/1gdoCa6x/march-2021-check-ins-europe-), serving as an asynchronous sharing space. The experiment ended in December, gathering barely any engagement.

IMAGE

For more documentation of our first digital gathering check out the [docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fa4i9OwoLGlFic4cqSMcgKOpaD0vC8iDIXOCNQIAScw/edit#heading=h.fqgynekc70si) and [schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U8D2eWEnNqkGqV5n77qENesd6lPLhfemWaXGB9Lwl9o/edit#gid=0).

In Spring 2021 we were still unsure if we will be able to host an IRL summer gathering. We decided to host a digital Enspiral Europe Connection Experiment: a 4 day online, off-screen-first meeting space to build connection between Enspiral Europe members.

IMAGE

The experiment combined spaces for 1:1 calls and reflections guided by a daily theme, inviting people to share.

IMAGE

The experiment didn't receive much interest with only a few people participating. That's perhaps due to a proximity to an [Enspiral Assembly Sprint](https://www.loomio.com/d/DmSu3bCw/assembly-sprint-2021-minimum-viable-revolution-), and suboptimal communication and framing of the experiment.

More documentation in [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JLLZ2VWNbjgYjc_KXPlr0vW6XWEwYoym8jNt9eiNSAQ/edit#).

## In-Person Gatherings

With the relaxation of Covid regulations we were able to introduce IRL gatherings, replicating the NZ rhythm of two gatherings per year, and [patterns for Enspiral Gatherings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dhhl-IUFZhU-_CZEb87-OTWC9wVpmDXjsgkiW5SPFyE/edit).¬†

It is worth noting that in the months between the gatherings we kept our **bi-weekly rhythm of Connection Calls**.

üé• Here‚Äôs a [conversation about weaving connection](https://youtu.be/Jy0OE0kR978) with Brigit Rozestraten.

‚≠êÔ∏è 25-30 August 2021 - **Enspiral Europe Gathering in Bergerac** (France), **our first IRL gathering**, hosted by Rich, Joriam, Brigit and Nati in a supporting role. Here's the [invitation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HuO5XM-2HuW0e6oJ8CVdU1CHKbzluFjYkeE3oJSDwfo/edit#heading=h.5prjuore2gdq). Theme: Deepening Our Togetherness.

‚≠êÔ∏è 24-27 Feb 2022 - Enspiral Europe Winter Gathering in Ch√¢teau Cortils (Belgium), hosted by Corinna, An and Rich. Here's [the invitation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pfvZs6er6HoGUM4UFwWtwbfSeFdvftDyvG_UAO-XYHU/edit#).

IMAGE

Our first two IRL gatherings reinforced by the connection calls and pods served as the main blocks of building belonging and kept the energy moving.¬†

It is worth noting, that until 2022 there has been little energy available for governance and building Enspiral Europe as a node within Enspiral.

‚≠êÔ∏è 22 April 2022 - **Setting up [Open Collective for Enspiral Europe](https://opencollective.com/enspiral-europe)** initially only for managing the funds for the upcoming Europe Summer Gathering. The Open Collective eventually became our transparent budget independent from Enspiral.

{% hint style="info" %}

In the meantime, Enspiral is undergoing a major structural change, moving away from two tier membership model and officially approving the node. Here‚Äôs the [Loomio thread](https://www.loomio.com/d/E8tlxj1X/what-is-emerging-creating-the-next-iteration-of-enspiral) summarising the process.

{% endhint %}
  
‚≠êÔ∏è 11-14 August 2022 - **Summer Gathering at Traditional Dream Factory** (Portugal), hosted by Brigit, Michal and Rich in a supporting role. Here's the [invitation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AFPHDXC7rf_WTWSGeOfOPVZYghDAKRWJvlbzmUijO2I/edit). Theme: *Ego System to Eco System: How can we become good ancestors?*

IMAGE

The Gathering resulted in the first Enspiral Europe governance open-space session with significant attendance. With more energy available for making governance decisions, we created our [handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OJfuUqFkm4ALaId50GIWSt9OCqedt1vtYqdojvoWRfw/edit#) and nominated node representatives. Here‚Äôs our [gathering harvest](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nUwtxCojtmjU684zBICLiR_MuhhT0z11Bn-JpEo0I2Q/edit#heading=h.xadgccqs3mks).

It‚Äôs worth noting that the handbook was prepared in advance with a list of [tasks, questions and ideas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lh1o6mIj7snJYJ56V3BlH8yona6EBM4EEeSrlmnDE9g/edit#), which made our discussion focused and effective.

üé• Here‚Äôs a [conversation about governance playground](https://youtu.be/_nSH7qoNYw0) with Dan Lewis

IMAGE

The Gathering catalyses the [EU People WG](https://www.loomio.com/d/NswGmnR1/eu-people-working-group), setup to facilitate the pods process, coordinate the On-boarding Pods, evaluate On-boarding and Pod Process, gather learnings and iterate the process and update the documentation.

‚≠êÔ∏è 21 September 2022 -¬† **Enspiral Board approves the Node Agreement**

(see in [Enspiral Handbook](/agreements/nodes.md))

IMAGE

‚≠êÔ∏è **Soon afterwards the Enspiral Europe Node is Approved.**

With the possibility of new nodes in Enspiral, it‚Äôs worth considering their inter-weaving relationships.

üé• Here‚Äôs a [conversation about inter-node coherence in Enspiral](https://youtu.be/TS24QCP6tmM) with Francesca Pick.
