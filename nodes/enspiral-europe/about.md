## Handbook
[Handbook: Enspiral Europe Node](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OJfuUqFkm4ALaId50GIWSt9OCqedt1vtYqdojvoWRfw/edit#) - an evolving document where we document the formal agreements that we collectively developed to govern ourselves, including our current Node Representatives. We are a new node and we expect that the policies there will be updated frequently as we learn what works.

You can see the current members of Enspiral Europe Node on our [Open Collective page](https://opencollective.com/enspiral-europe).
