# Board of Directors

As a registered New Zealand company, Enspiral Foundation Ltd has to have directors. Enspiral’s goal is to distribute vision, strategy, and leadership as widely as possible in the network, so our approach is a “minimum viable board” (MVB), with a narrow compliance focus. You can see the details in the [Board Agreement](/agreements/board.html).

**Responsibilities**

* Legal and financial compliance
* Management of major risk
* Steward of the Enspiral brand

**Activities**

* Oversee the Foundation’s financial accounts
* Make agreements between the Enspiral Foundation and other entities (MOUs, Service contracts)
* Occasionally make recommendations or raise issues to the members or the network as a whole
* Have some emergency powers to use in rare crisis situations if our other processes have broken down

**Reporting**

The MVB reports regularly to the network as a whole [on Loomio](https://www.loomio.org/d/oFN6x8t5/re-introducing-the-enspiral-foundation-mvb-board-of-directors-), and participates quarterly venture reporting (since Enspiral Foundation Ltd is itself an Enspiral Venture).

**Scope**

The point of a ‘minimum’ board is that the scope is limited - the MVB specifically focuses on Enspiral Foundation Ltd (not the entire Enspiral network), and within that only governance.

Examples of things within scope:

* an MOU between the Enspiral Foundation and an external organisation
* an issue with one of the Foundation’s service contracts (such as Enspiral Ops)
* a serious concern about brand or reputation risk, or if you’re unsure when it’s OK to use Enspiral’s brand publicly
* a question about running a transaction through the Foundation’s bank account

## Current Directors

### Ants Cabraal
Ants has worked across several ventures in roles like investor, director, co-founder, business development, marketing & creative production. Currently focused on building Enspiral ventures working in education and professional development. He stays up late scheming about creative projects to help make the world a more peaceful place.

### Bart de Vries
Bart is intent on moving the world. He has an eclectic background. Working as a Physiotherapist with high performance/professional athletes as well as helping Joe blog with with an injury or persistent pain get back to living, life and work. He has also spent a lot of his life playing sport himself, travelling the world playing golf, playing hockey here for Capital and heading to the Netherlands for 2 seasons to experience a professionals lifestyle (as well as becoming a coffee roaster). Bart then came back to Wellington a year ago and started a market stall making Dutch Stroopwafels (strOpee). This was a project to see if you can develop meaning out of something seemingly meaningless and learn about business. While launching strOpee Bart was also fully involved in creating a new Physiotherapy space and service in Palmerston North.

Now Bart is back in Wellington and intent on moving the world, getting people focused on their health, wellbeing, their vitality and happiness. He no longer wants to be at the bottom of the cliff but rather is getting to the top, fencing it off and sign posting to make an impact on how this world functions and where to moves to next.

### Billy Matheson
I am a social entrepreneur who brings a unique set of skills and perspectives to every project I get involved with. My educational background is in Industrial Design (B.Des Victoria) and Adult Education (M.Ed, Massey). In 2009 I was involved in founding the ReGeneration youth leadership project in partnership with Enviroschools and the Tindall Foundation, where I met many Enspiral people. In 2012 I was employed by Auckland Council as their Principal Advisor on Social Entrepreneurship, a role that I was in for three years. I am involved with three Enspiral Ventures and serve in a governance capacity with a number of other companies and trusts.

I really like working with complexity, and for that reason I want the things that can be simple and clear to be as simple and clear as possible - like the MVB. The key thing to understand about the MVB concept is that, if it works, it will free the directors to focus on governance rather than operational issues. With the Catalysts in action, Venture Stewards doing their thing, and the Enspiral Handbook underway, the MVB can get on with fundamental compliance issues like processes for appointing new directors, financial reporting, and managing risk. It also means that, like directors of any other Enspiral venture, we can spend more time thinking about how Enspiral Foundation Ltd can be more awesome. This is a massive improvement on what we had before, so definitely watch this space!
