**Enspiral is a network of people who support each other to do meaningful work.**

Or at least that's one way to define what Enspiral is. Check out [our website](https://enspiral.com) for more context. You might also be inspired by our blog [Enspiral Tales](https://medium.com/enspiral-tales) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lScGElP49Jc) created at Enspiral Summer Fest 2018.

Our [**monthly newsletter**](https://mailchi.mp/4be697ce0c7b/enspiral-newsletter) is a great way to receive updates from our network.

- [ ] [this quick slideshow](http://whatis.enspiral.com), and [this 90 second video](https://vimeo.com/125088390) are fantastic but include outdated info about Enspiral structure. It would be great to re-edit if possible, or alternatively archive.

## About This Handbook

This Handbook's primary audience is Enspiral members, but it will be publicly available for others who might find it useful. **The goal is to give everyone in the network as much clarity and context as possible, while sharing our structures and practices with the outside world as well.**

Our handbook is designed as an **always relevant living document**. The handbook is constantly changing, and certain links point towards internal documents which contain the most up-to-date information. If you see something that could be improved: that's your invitation to improve it! [Find out more about editing the handbook](guides/contributing.md).

## Structure

The book is broken up into chapters and sub-chapters. The chapters are:

* [**Agreements**](agreements/) are the official legislation that governs the Enspiral network. Changing these requires a formal process.
* [**Nodes**](nodes/) lists formal subgroups within our network
* [**Guides**](guides/) explain in practical terms how we do stuff, like [what communications tools to use](guides/comms_guidelines.md), or [how to improve things at Enspiral](guides/improvements.md). Any Enspiral Contributor can change these.
* [**Working Groups**](working-groups/) are where we do work on the network.
* [**Enspiral Foundation**](foundation/) - the central node in the network. The [Board](foundation/board.md), [Ops Team](foundation/ops-scope.md), [Comms person](foundation/comms-role.md), and [Ventures](ventures/) all have some formal arrangement with the Foundation, which is owned by Foundation Shareholders.
* [**Money**](money/) - a lot of what makes Enspiral special is how we deal with money. Read more about those processes in this chapter.
* [**Ventures**](ventures/) - the companies that make up the network.
* [**Resources**](web/enspiral-handbook-2023/nodes/enspiral-europe/resources.md) - a list of useful links
* [**Archive**](archive/) compiles outdated info from previous iterations of this handbook for future reference.
