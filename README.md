# Introduction

{% hint style="info" %}

This is a beta version of the 2023 update to [Enspiral Handbook](https://handbook.enspiral.com) funded via [Fall'22 cobudget round](https://cobudget.com/enspiral/funding-round-2022/cl8sptz8h015509l2i8evb6vw). Do you have feedback / share-backs / want to build upon what's here? Reach out to Michał on Slack, send a note via [this form](https://airtable.com/shrZu4VyT3Dtcvwwx), or schedule a call with me [ADD LINK]. The last option would allow us to record a chilled podcast (if you feel like), which is a cool way to co-create content for Enspiral. Wishing you a magnificent day! ✨

**Enspiral is a network of friends who support each other to do meaningful work.**

Our DNA:

- Sharing resources
- Decentralising power
- *What do you need?*

Or at least that's one way to define what Enspiral is. Check out [our website](https://enspiral.com) for more context. You might also be inspired by our blog [Enspiral Tales](https://medium.com/enspiral-tales) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lScGElP49Jc) created at Enspiral Summer Fest 2018.

Our **monthly newsletter** is a great way to receive updates from our network. [ADD LINK]

Comment: [this quick slideshow](http://whatis.enspiral.com), and [this 90 second video](https://vimeo.com/125088390) are great but include outdated info about Enspiral structure. It would be great to re-edit if possible, or alternatively remove for now.

## About This Handbook

This Handbook's primary audience is Enspiral contributors, but it will be publicly available for others who might find it useful. **The goal is to give everyone in the network as much clarity and context as possible, while sharing our structures and practices with the outside world as well.**

This book is in perpetual beta, it's constantly changing. If you see something that could be improved: that's your invitation to improve it! [Find out more about editing the handbook](guides/contributing.md).

## Structure

The book is broken up into chapters and sub-chapters. The chapters are:

* [**Agreements**](agreements/) are the official legislation that governs the Enspiral network. Changing these requires a formal process.
* [**Guides**](guides/) explain in practical terms how we do stuff, like [what communications tools to use](guides/comms_guidelines.md), or [how to improve things at Enspiral](guides/improvements.md). Any Enspiral Contributor can change these.
* [**Working Groups**](working-groups/) are where we do work on the network.
* [**Nodes**](nodes/) list "subgroups" within our network
* [**Enspiral Foundation**](foundation/) - the central node in the network. The [Board](foundation/board.md), [Ops Team](foundation/ops-scope.md), [Comms person](foundation/comms-role.md), and [Ventures](ventures/) all have some formal arrangement with the Foundation, which is owned by Foundation Shareholders.
* [**Money**](money/) - a lot of what makes Enspiral special is how we deal with money. Read more about those processes in this chapter.
* [**Ventures**](ventures/) - the companies that make up the network.
* [**Resources**](resources.md) - a list of useful links
* [**Archive**](archive/) compiles outdates info from previous iterations of our handbook, which feels like it's worth preserving to honour our lineage and for future reference.
