# New Contributor On-boarding info
When a new contributor joins Enspiral, they receive a series of six email messages over six weeks for orientation to the network - how it functions and how they can participate. In the last email, we ask for feedback about their experience.

The message series is part of a project by the Ops Team at Enspiral to improve the experience of new Contributors coming into Enspiral. If you have feedback or would like to contribute to this project email [foundation@enspiral.com](mailto://foundation@enspiral.com)


## Week 1 email : Welcome and communications tools
Welcome to Enspiral! We're stoked to have you here.

This is the start of your journey into the Enspiral Network. As a new contributor, you’ll get 3 months to explore what we’re about and see if this community is right for you. Over the next six weeks you’ll be sent a message from us each week to help you along your journey.

Week 1 : Welcome and communications tools

Week 2 : Meet your Enspiral Buddy

Week 3 : What it means to be an Enspiral Contributor

Week 4 : Getting informed about Enspiral

Week 5 : Getting active in Enspiral

Week 6 : Tell us how you’re going

At any time you can access any of these messages on the [Onboarding page in our Enspiral Handbook].

Our communications tools.
At Enspiral we use a number of online platforms to meet our organisational needs. As a new contributor, you should have received an invite to all of these. If any of these hasn’t turned up feel free to send us a message at foundation@enspiral.com.

Core channels for everyone :

Enspiral News - our fortnightly newsletter with important info and announcements.

[Loomio](https://www.loomio.org/g/1xCPyY46/enspiral) - this is where all of our important discussions and decisions happen. To be a meaningful part of Enspiral, showing up here is essential.

[Cobudget](http://cobudget.co/#/) - this is how we decide how to spend our surplus each month. Anyone in the network can propose ideas for funding and people who have contributed financially to the network allocate their money here.

[Chalkle](https://chalkle.com/enspiral) - this is where official Enspiral events are listed. Everyone in the network is able to post events here you’d like to host.
Optional channels :
Feel free to pick and choose from these different places Enspiralites hang out online.

[Slack](https://enspiral.slack.com/messages) - team messaging app where informal conversations are held. Remember to fill out [your profile](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204092246-Editing-your-profile) as soon as you can!

[Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/enspiral/) - informal discussions and inspiration-sharing.

[GitHub](https://github.com/enspiral) - documentation and code development.

We know this is quite a lot to take in. We suggest you start with Loomio and your choice of optional channels and go from there. You can also check out our [Comms Guide](http://handbook.enspiral.com/comms_guidelines.html) for more information.

## Week 3 email: So what does it mean to be an Enspiral Contributor?
Kia ora,

So what does it mean to be an Enspiral Contributor?

Enspiral Contributors are the life of Enspiral. But what are you contributing to and how do you do it? Below is an extended version of our [People Agreement](https://enspiral.gitbooks.io/enspiral-handbook/content/people_agreement.html) which sets out what is required, expected and encouraged from Contributors in being valuable citizens of Enspiral.

Required :

  * Accept the invitation to the Enspiral Loomio group

  * Follow agreed Enspiral policies (such as the [Diversity Agreement](https://enspiral.gitbooks.io/enspiral-handbook/content/diversity_agreement.html))

  * Opt in after 3 months and every 12 months after that, and make a self-set financial contribution (see [Financial Agreement](https://enspiral.gitbooks.io/enspiral-handbook/content/financial_agreement.html))

Expected :

  * Participate in online communications channels and collective decisions on Loomio.

  * Allocate funds in [Cobudget](http://cobudget.co/#/groups/41) when you have them.

  * Contribute to the internal culture of support and generosity.

  * Help build Enspiral in your own way - no one here will tell you what to do.

  * If you notice something that can be improved, work on it or talk to people about it. Starting a [seed on Hylo](https://www.hylo.com/c/enspiral) or [posting a bucket idea in Cobudget](http://cobudget.co/#/buckets/new?group_id=41) is a great place to start.

  * If you access an opportunity through Enspiral, set it up to contribute back to the network in some way e.g. become an Enspiral Services contributor, contract Enspiral Ventures to work on it.
  
  * Learn about our social mission and [uphold our values](https://enspiral.gitbooks.io/enspiral-handbook/content/values.html).

Encouraged :

  * Attend Enspiral retreats and events

  * Host events, share your knowledge and skills through our [Chalkle channel](https://chalkle.com/enspiral)

  * Propose buckets in [Cobudget](http://enspiral.us1.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=62b0ebd5c3dbb30bced6e6cf9&id=7ec3a82a55&e=7add41283b), and work on other’s projects

  * Refer opportunities to Enspiral people and ventures

  * Respond to invitations to participate in network initiatives and contribute to setting the direction of the network
  * Do commercial work through ventures in the network to enhance your livelihood and that of others

Got some thoughts on this? For more background on [this agreement] and to ask questions, see [this Loomio discussion](https://www.loomio.org/d/N2DF7PeQ/-refactor-people-agreement).
 
Happy contributing!
