# Agreement: Stewardship

Stewardship agreement:

* Every member has a steward.
* Every new contributor has a steward. By default, this will be the person who added them.
* Eventually everyone who wants one will have a steward.
* Anyone can be a steward.
* Anyone taking on a named role (e.g. Catalyst, Matchmaker) needs a steward.

Your steward looks after your relationship with the group, your one guaranteed point of contact. You and your steward can agree the scope of the role together. As a suggested start point, they should check in with you once per month to see how youâ€™re going.
