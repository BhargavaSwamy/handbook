##Contributor processes

###Onboarding

Enspiral Members complete the “Add new contributor form” listed on the [Forms page](https://handbook.enspiral.com/guides/forms.html) in the handbook. Members are the new Contributor’s Steward by default unless they have arranged for someone else to be their Steward. 

Upon completion of this Form, Ops receives a notification with all of the details. At the same time, the new Contributor is sent an automated email with a link and request to complete the Contributor Details Form. Ops waits for the new Contributor to complete this form before onboarding them to the Enspiral apps and systems. 

The new Contributor completes this form, supplying the following info: Facebook login email, personal tagline/origin story, website, ask me about…, skills, activities, values, interests, bio/introduction, aspirations within the network. Ops receives a notification when the form is completed and that the Contributor is ready to be onboarded to the network.

Ops onboards the new Contributor by inviting them to join to the following systems:

- Enspiral Loomio
- Enspiral Slack
- Secret Enspiral Facebook Group
- Cobudget
- Added to the Foundation Google Apps Contributors Group
- Added to receive the [Onboarding Email Series](https://handbook.enspiral.com/guides/onboarding-info.html)

If the new Contributor is getting an Enspiral Google Apps account, all of the above invites are generally sent to the new Google Apps account address unless the contributor prefers for these to be sent to their personal address.

At this point the Contributor is considered “Onboarded” with a “Trial” status. The onboard date is created and a new Opt-in Request date is set for 3 months (90 days) after the onboard date. The [Contributors & Members Directory](https://docs.google.com/a/enspiral.com/spreadsheets/d/1-ZdYOEZ9KXpd8W166Pt-uTQdrsoXcmgZkURU3955L-w/edit?usp=drive_web) is updated with the new Contributors details.

Once the new Contributor has logged into the Loomio Enspiral Group for the first time, Ops receives a notification. Ops introduces the new Contributor in the [New contributor welcome and introductions Discussion in Loomio](https://www.loomio.org/d/n1Uie3LW/new-contributor-welcome-and-introductions), tagging their inviting Member and Steward, and records the welcome date in the back end database. Ops then invites the new Contributor to join the “[Enspiral Opportunities // Ask Enspiral](https://www.loomio.org/g/9G8VrBKv/enspiral-enspiral-opportunities-ask-enspiral)” Enspiral Loomio sub-group.

The new Contributor is now fully onboarded to all of Enspiral’s systems.

###Annual opt-in

After 3 months in the network, and once a year after that, we ask Contributors to proactively decide if they'd like to stay on in the network. (Enspiral members are also contributors, and they go through this same process).

- Near the "Subscription Date" dictated by the above 3-month or annual Enspiral birthdate, Contributors are sent an email with a custom-link to the Opt-in form. This is sent via Mandrill, with the name "Charley at Enspiral Foundation". The email is sent to both the "preferred email address" from our database of Contributors. We recently modified this to also send a Slack notification to the contributor about their request to "Opt-in". At this point, an email is also sent to the Contributor's Steward, if they have one, suggesting that this is a good time to check in with them, since this is a specific period of time that they'll be considering to Opt-in or out of the network. (Stewards have the option of not receiving this notification.)

- Two weeks after sending the "Opt-in" email, if Ops does not receive a response from the contributor, a "Final Reminder" email is sent to the contributor at both their personal and enspiral email addresses (if they have one), with their custom opt-in google form link, and a caution that if we do not receive a response within one further week, we'll take it to mean that they're Opting-out by default. We also send a reminder via Enspiral Slack (recently added notification.)

- Four weeks after sending the "Opt-in" email, if Ops still does not receive a response, we send a "Farewell" email to the Contributor (at both email addresses), saying that we will be removing them from Enspiral systems within one week, unless there's been some mistake. At this point, we also send a follow-up email notification to the Contributor's Steward, advising that unless they think there's been some mistake or problem with the contributor opting-in, Ops will opt-out the contributor by default and remove them from Enspiral systems.

- Five weeks after sending the "Opt-in" email, if Ops has not received any notification from the Contributor or Steward, we presume the Contributor does not wish to stay in the network and we process the Contributor to be removed from the Enspiral Systems

###Offboarding

Contributors are offboarded from the network: either when they decide to leave the network at the annual opt-in date or by default if they have not responded to the Opt-in requests.

Ops receives a notification that a Contributor would like to Opt-out or has not responded to the Opt-in requests.

Ops removes the Contributor’s accounts from the following Enspiral systems:

- Enspiral Loomio Group (this also removes them from the “Ask Enspiral // Enspiral Opportunites sub-group)
- Secret Enspiral Facebook Group
- Cobudget (any remaining funds are recycled into the next Cobudget round ***currently in construction***)
- Removed from the Foundation Google Apps Contributors Group
- Removed from the Monthly Enspiral Newsletter e-mail list
- Slack: (Note: you cannot fully “remove” users, instead the Contributor’s account is “disabled”)

If the Contributor has a Google Apps account (a "name@enspiral.com" account), they are notified via email and Slack that their Google Apps account will be removed in two weeks. Ops schedules the Google Apps account removal date. After two weeks, the account is removed and any remaining Google Drive documents owned by the contributor is re-assigned to a nominated account managed by Ops. If the Contributor is also in a Venture, Ops updates the repeating invoices to the Venture for the Google Apps account.

##Cobudget Processes

Ops is working with the Greaterthan team to deliver the collaborative funding for the network through Cobudget. Cobudget is currently run in monthly funding rounds. The following is a detailed description of the operational processes that back up the action on Cobudget and in the Enspiral Foundation bank accounts. (Contributors only: view [this Loomio discussion](https://www.loomio.org/d/DbW3nipl/it-s-time-facilitated-cobudget-) for the latest discussion about collaborative funding rounds.)

Enspiral Foundation has a dedicated "Collab Funding" bank account, which houses the "real money" total amount for all of the funds circulating in the Cobudget platform. Ops runs a spreadsheet database in collaboration with Greaterthan as a bridge between Cobudget and the banka account. While Cobudget continues to be developed, the total funds in the Collab Funding bank account is comprised of the following allocations/breakdown of this total in Cobudget:

* **Available Funds** - this appears at the top of the screen and shows the total unspent funds in your individual account. The figure to the right of this shows the total 'unspent funds' for the whole group, including: unspent funds in all individual accounts, including invited users with funds.
* **Total Incomplete** - this is the total value of funded incomplete buckets
* **"Funded Now" Total in "Funding" Buckets** - this is the total amount of funds that have been allocated to "Funding" buckets
* **Completed Unpaid Buckets** - this is the total amount of funds sitting in "Completed" but "Unpaid" buckets, that is buckets that haven't been paid out with real money from the Collab Funding bank account.

Not all of the above is clearly represented at present in Cobudget. As such, Ops and Greaterthan uses a spreadsheet to track the total funds in Cobudget vs. the total in the Collab Funding bank account.

###How funds enter Cobudget
Contributors can allocate funds to their individual Cobudget account as part of the annual Opt-in process or via the  [Variable contributions](https://handbook.enspiral.com/finances_variable_contributions.html) form. For tax purposes, **Variable contributions** are treated differently than the funds allocated as part of annual Opt-ins. (View the above link for further details about this). 

Once this money is received in the Enspiral Foundation bank account, Ops reconciles the bank payment in Xero and adds a record of this payment to the Cobudget "Audit log". This list of users and Cobudget contributions in the Audit Log are queued up for the subsequent funding round. At the start of a funding round, these funds are added to individual contributor accounts. Ventures also make contributions to Cobudget to team accounts; these payments are similarly recorded into this audit log.

###General funding round process
* At the start of a funding round: Greaterthan enter Funded Buckets from the previous round into the Cobudget spreadsheet dashboard.
* Ops receives a notification that there is a new Funded Bucket
* Once the bucket details are entered in the spreadsheet, an email is then sent to the bucket owner with instructions on how to invoice Enspiral Foundation. (Specifically this email is triggered from a Zap based on the "Status" column of the row). The invoice must include: the total amount for the bucket (remember, the amounts in Cobudget are GST-exclusive), bucket name and URL, a clear indication of whether GST is included in your invoice, and the recipient's bank account number.
* The bucket owner sends the invoice to Foundation and Ops enters this in Xero as a bill for payment.
* The 'real money' payment is made from the Collab Funding account to the recipient and Ops changes the status of the bucket in the spreadsheet to 'Paid' and records any necessary comments. The bucket balance total in this spreadsheet is reduced accordingly. 
* Simultaneously, at the start of a funding round, Greaterthan add funds from the Audit Log list of queued funds to individual's accounts.
* Once Greaterthan have confirmed that funds have been allocated, Ops audits the total in Cobudget with the spreadsheet dashboard and makes a once-monthly transfer in/out of the Collab-funding account to/from the Invoices/Expenses account or Reserves.
* Greaterthan facilitates and opens the new funding round and the above process repeats at the end/beginning of the next cycle.
* Ops marks the bucket in Cobudget as 'Completed'.
