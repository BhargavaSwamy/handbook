##Contributor processes

###Onboarding

###Annual opt-in

After 3 months in the network, and once a year after that, we ask Contributors to proactively decide if they'd like to stay on in the network. (Enspiral members are also contributors, and they go through this same process).

- Near the "Subscription Date" dictated by the above 3-month or annual Enspiral birthdate, Contributors are sent an email with a custom-link to the Opt-in form. This is sent via our operationshelpdesk Gmail account, with the name "Charley at Enspiral Foundation". The email is sent to both a "Personal email address" and secondary "Enspiral email address" from our database of Contributors. We recently modified this to also send a Slack notification to the contributor about their request to "Opt-in". At this point, an email is also sent to the Contributor's Steward, if they have one, suggesting that this is a good time to check in with them, since this is a specific period of time that they'll be considering to Opt-in or out of the network. (Stewards have the option of not receiving this notification.)

- One week after sending the "Opt-in" email, if Ops does not receive a response from the contributor, a "Final Reminder" email is sent to the contributor at both their personal and enspiral email addresses (if they have one), with their custom opt-in google form link, and a caution that if we do not receive a response within one further week, we'll take it to mean that they're Opting-out by default. We also send a reminder via Enspiral Slack (recently added notification.)

- Two weeks after sending the "Opt-in" email, if Ops still does not receive a response, we send a "Farewell" email to the Contributor (at both email addresses), saying that we will be removing them from Enspiral systems within one week, unless there's been some mistake. At this point, we also send a follow-up email notification to the Contributor's Steward, advising that unless they think there's been some mistake or problem with the contributor opting-in, Ops will opt-out the contributor by default and remove them from Enspiral systems.

- Three weeks after sending the "Opt-in" email, if Ops has not received any notification from the Contributor or Steward, we presume the Contributor does not wish to stay in the network and we process the Contributor to be removed from the Enspiral Systems

###Offboarding
