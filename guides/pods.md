# What's a pod

A _pod_ is a small group of (typically 3 to 5) enspirally humans° that connect regularly around one or more shared intentions. We have developed this practice to be useful for folks who can't get together in person, noting that the opportunity to meet face-to-face can add priceless value. At the broadest level, these intentions tend to implicitly or explicitly include mutual support, care, and building relationships. However, every Pod is unique, and the intentions may vary (project-based, topic-based, learning together, personal-professional development, and beyond). Enspiral Working Groups can be understood as a type of Pod.

° _Obviously, pods can be comprised of those outside of Enspiral; for our purpose here we're focussed on groups that have at least one or two Contributors_.

# Getting started

If you're starting, joining, or participating in a pod you may prefer to [jump into the resource guide, below](#resource-guide).

If you want to know more about the pods initiative, read on!

# Why

People have a need for what Enspiral has to offer, and our purpose and our communities could benefit from more active Contributors, but there are various obstacles that interfere with us having the mutual value exchanges that could help us further into relationship with new folks or those who have stepped away.

At the same time, Enspiral has limited diversity and could benefit from more – _not least in that we seek to be an innovative bunch_. There's various reasons for the limited diversity, but there is one challenge that stands out as an opportunity here...

We've noticed it’s hard to meet people or to figure out how to participate – _eg, in value generating activities_ – unless you’re already connected to several active Contributors; the pathways that don’t require high social capital in this sense require a lot of time and effort, and a particular learning style conducive to text-heavy, asynchronous engagement and sense-making. This makes it less likely that we would invite folks who are different than ourselves.

## How pods can help

People in pods have shared how it "Helps them feel more connected to the network" and "deepened relationship with the participants". They've also attested that it's energy-giving, inspiring, and a "great place to experience belonging and the power of being vulnerable".

Here's some other ways we see pods having big potential for a network such as ours:
- Support more people to be _seen_, i.e., experience of belonging & contributing, mutual support
- Grow individuals’ social capital (and ours)
- Make it easier to understand Enspiral, make context more accessible to people with diverse stories and backgrounds, increasing the agency of Contributors
- Encourage collaboration and learning together, practicing and realizing better ways of being
- Improve our ability, as a network and in our groups, to adapt, and to define shared visions that support us and our work

# Resource guide

This guide is a place to highlight the best resources we have to offer pods so that you and your pod members can have increasingly generative experiences through this practice.

At the highest level, we have articulated some patterns we've seen in successful pods:

- [Patterns for Pods (1 pager)](/guides/pods_patterns.html)

Below you will find a number of principles, formats, and rituals that can be used to create and hold a space and practice that is generative for your pod's members, even if you are new to this, just jumping on board and responding to an invitation to participate. Pods are co-created experiences.

# Elements of pods

Successful pods are likely to implicitly or explicitly have organized around the following elements; if you are _calling_ a group together (making the initial invitation and coordinating the first meeting) and you have a strong ideas regarding any of these elements, it’s good to share this as early as possible, perhaps in the invitation you make when you shoulder-tap potential pod members.

1. **Shared intention** is a clear statement of the common intent bringing a group together (e.g. studying a topic together or going through a self-development methodology).
2. **Principles** are the set of rules, protocols and values the define the culture of the pod. _For example on the topic of facilitation we could have a protocol, « facilitation is a responsibility that rotates around our pod's members »_.
3. **Formats** give structure to how the process will unfold. The _free format_ is a format in which people simply decide to meet around a shared intention without following a specific methodology or structure. In contrast, the [Care Pod (ICT) format](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IUXBpZJas2MRNlrKDu4KBivZjBw67RQ9o7accovv4fU) defines a series of exercises that your group may go through in a specific order through their different encounters. Some formats may not have an evolutionary nature from one call to the next, but instead be meant to provide structure to the calls (e.g., this [Care Pod (peer incubation) format](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E0Bt0bSRpARKgMNRYWboIELbSTurfPMedHOWDYUCHIo/edit?usp=sharing))
4. **Rituals** are practices that help boost the interactivity of your calls so that they feel much richer and deeper than a dull chat. Some of them call for forward preparation to concentrate even more connecting energy into the limited time of a call. Proceeding with a moment of silence before checking-in is an example of ritual. Being creative here might help creating online experiences you never knew were possible.

## Shared intention

_Why are we doing this together? What is it that we are doing together?_

It's helpful to think about curating the pod around the role people want it to play in their lives – e.g., sounding board, emotional support, personal-professional development, topic- or project-based, learning group, weightlifting...


## Principles

_How do we want to show up for each other? How do we want to treat one another? How do we want to go about this?_

Like we mentioned above, principles include protocols that guide your group when you're asking "who speaks next, what do we all want to talk about, and who's facilitating?" Principles are not limited to facilitation rules and may also address the following or beyond.

- Categories and bulleted examples are by no means exhaustive – we'd love to hear yours! Drop them in [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IlFsQMSXzkJZ6AF59Zwg6mNrWGl86Bk2wUpYRqAXxqs/edit?usp=sharing).

We've pasted in the text from the last five points of the [Patterns for Pods (1 pager)](/guides/pods_patterns.html) which suggest that you might consider principles around Boundaries, Cadence, Cycles and Retrospectives, and Sharing Learning.

**Boundaries**

_What are you up for? And what are you not up for?_ Talk about your _norms_ and _boundaries_. E.g., being respectful with each other, setting a confidentiality agreement, etc.

**Cadence**

_How often are you meeting?_ Some pods do it every week for a while and then change to longer cadence, fortnightly or monthly. Is up to your pod members to decide. Having a regular time (e.g., first Monday of the month) makes it significantly easier to get together.

**Cycles**

_When do you stop? When do you reflect?_ Start with the end in mind or with a moment when you will stop and reflect (more on it in the Retrospective part below)

**Retrospective / Continuous improvement**

Agree on a time to stop and reflect on how is the pod working for each member: _What is working well? What can be better? What are we going to change?_

- You can use that reflection point as a good place to decide if you stop or if you keep on going, and how.

**Sharing Learnings**

Share what you learn in your Retrospective with the network so we can all learn together. We will have shared learning prompts within the network every 3 months, and an open thread where everyone can post what have they learned from specific Formats and Rituals.

**Meeting preparation**

- Make sure everyone is clear on the time, date, and place / _link to a video client° if geographically separated_
 - Event pages can be a big help, or anything people can add to their calendar with just a click°°
- Have an agenda
 - Even better, have an agenda at least a week in advance

° _we recommend [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si/) as a free and open source video call option, and [zoom](zoom.us) is excellent if you have access to a paid zoom subscription or are going for less than 40 minutes_

°° _Loomio is able to send calendar invites after you use a Time Poll; if you can stand Google, their Calendar gives you the ability to modify the event and easily send changes._

**Set-up concerns**

- Please only attend a call from a place where letting go, lying down, crying or laughing out loud wouldn’t be an issue
- Some groups prefer to be able to have everyone's face visible
- Take consideration of lighting and audio quality; headphone (with mics) can help heaps. So can quiet spaces.

### Additional 'resilience' principles

**Easy exit**

- _Protocol_: We invite anyone in this pod to leave at anytime. A commemoration ritual will be held every time that occurs for the group to help integrate the learning of the ex-member’s contributions
 - _Rationale_: To help mitigate risk of people having a dispute about common issues.

**Assume positive intent, but attend to the impact**

- _Protocol_: If your group adopts this as a general protocol (or learning agreement etc.), it's an invitation for people to check that they are starting from a place of trust, and to make sure that impact of people's actions and words are attended to, that when harm is done there is (pro)active response.
 - _Rationale_: For building brave or courageous spaces. This is likely only needed in groups that intend to explore subjects that might be trying for the participants, or are groups that have a tension built in. This helps groups go further afield or deeper into more tricky or delicate matters.

**Speak from the I**

... and all other brilliant suggestions from Non-Violent Communication (NVC). If you are running into interpersonal friction, or are having trouble communicating with your group members, you might want to consider [this one-pager](https://www.nonviolentcommunication.com/pdf_files/4part_nvc_process.pdf) as a quick guide to the deep wealth of NVC practice.

- _Protocol_: If your group agrees on "speak from the I" as a protocol, the intention is that folks will try not to speak on behalf of another person or the group as a whole, or at least not to do so in tense situations
 - _Rationale_: Again, likely only needed for groups that are travelling into more vulnerable territory together. See NVC resources for more on the 'why'.

### Assorted protocols and principles

These will hopefully spark an insight of a useful principle you could propose for your pod:

- Confidentiality
- Open to new members? ...to guests?
- Acknowledge the expectations of others before expressing your own
- Look at your plans from a distance and create space for emergence
- Accept differences but express dissent


## Rituals

The concrete gestures, practices, and motions your group can go through during the sessions to really bring it to life.

While all rituals we document are intended to support a group’s development, some particularly support them to develop intimacy, e.g., _[Showing Up With a Treasure](#showing-up-with-a-treasure)_. When you introduce these it can help to pay attention to how it affects the atmosphere of the call. Note that different people may have more or less desire for crossing boundaries and learning about each other. Be aware that inviting the adoption of a ritual may sometime make some people feel excluded and potentially willing to leave the pod (e.g., they’re not comfortable doing this).

Below are the Rituals we've curated; we'd love to see yours – drop them in [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ER84YbDSHNTLyQQ05hRJiqjwzFVb-EAoE8hUIoo5psM/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Three conversations for initiating a group

1. How do we want to interact together? What’s the intention – or the outcomes or experiences that are hoped for – of our meetings?

> a. You can ask things like, ‘what would be wildly ideal’ and ‘what would spoil this for you’... exploring the extremes of what would be good for each individual can help you create healthy boundaries and expectations for the group

2. What recurring meeting time could work for us?

> having a concrete cadence, not having to find a time again and again, has a big impact on your group’s chances!

3. What are folks ready to commit to?

> a. This is the culminating question of the previous two explorations, and also gives people a concrete sense of ownership and dedication to the plan you laid out

> b. It’s helpful if the commitment question includes a proposal of a duration—at the end of which you’ll have a retrospective or group reflection—in addition to the intention and cadence

#### Presence in silence

Life can be hectic and participant may have rushed into the call with stress and other thoughts in mind. Keeping silent for a few minutes (even just 1) can help ground everyone into the moment and improve the capacity of immediacy of the participants.

#### Showing up with a Treasure

Join the meeting with a physical object. It could have intrinsic subjective value or be anything helping you illustrate a short story that is important to you. Presenting it during the opening of the call can yield multiple benefits, starting with remembering ourselves what it is we treasure in life, practising storytelling and giving an opportunity to other pod members to get to know you.

#### Invite the energies of…

This is a way to share how we feel or what we feel we’re lacking. Best used after some moment of silence during the opening. E.g. « I invite the energies of VULNERABILITY to help me face the shame of my procrastination ». Or « I invite the energy of A FRESH WATER to help me combat sleepiness » (the participant could splash themselves with water as they say this)

####Gratitude & praising the rules

Can be done as part of a closing. Express gratitude to other participants for how they enact into being the set of principles and rules were agreed within the pod and what beneficial impact that had for them. This helps each-other constantly remember the value of some of the rules / rituals.

#### Process based on Intentional Change Theory

Best suited to groups with a strong focus on personal-professional development; [see here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u6CZB4UQohOChFr0d-DNny3OWEUZIq2lMpWOf15LUNM/edit).

#### Case clinic (from Theory U)

Best suited to groups with a strong focus on personal-professional development; [see here](https://www.presencing.org/files/tools/PI_Tool_CaseClinic.pdf).

#### Project Kitchens

A more practical, project-oriented exercise helping small group build collective intelligence by giving mutual support to their projects; [see here](/guides/project_kitchen.html) or [here (lighter version)](https://www.collaboratiohelvetica.ch/blog/2017/11/20/mmrb05mfc3nlnxfqw2r9pcq26ietjp).

### Enacting 'resilience'

Below are some 'Rituals for resilience' to overcome some of the common culprits pods face:

And here's some that we could use some ideas about! (We'd love to hear from you! [Drop exercises in here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ER84YbDSHNTLyQQ05hRJiqjwzFVb-EAoE8hUIoo5psM/edit?usp=sharing))
- Dealing with timezones issues
- Facilitation burnout
- « Feeling like the black sheep in the white herd » issue

#### Conflict Transformation

See our [Conflict Resolution / Transformative Justice guide](https://handbook.enspiral.com/guides/conflict-resolution.html) which has some great steps and a number of resources. 

### Some oldies and goodies (from Enspiral's Workshops Guide)

Copying and pasting some relevant Rituals from the [Workshop Patterns](/guides/workshop_patterns.html) guide

#### Check in

*Process:* We start events with a check in. Everyone in a circle, sitting or standing (more energetic). Facilitator gives a prompt, then we go around and hear from everybody, e.g. how are you feeling on a scale 1-5?, or, what’s something you feel grateful for this morning? Remind people to be brief. Funny ice breaker questions can break tensions if the group doesn’t work together often (e.g. “each of you has a super power, what’s yours?”)

You can also invite people to say what they are looking forward to in the workshop or what they would like to get out of it.

*Rationale:* Demonstrates that all voices are important. Also, we care about how you’re feeling.

#### Agenda/Programme/Timeline

*Process*: Ensure that a rough outline of the day is written on a shared document or chat. Go through it in a bit of detail at the beginning if people won't have already been familiar.

*Rationale*: This gives people a lay of the land and an overview of what to expect and how to orientate themselves in it.


#### Twinkle fingers / Direct response

*Process* Introduce new ways of communication by explicitly letting folks know what they mean. You might introduce sparkle/twinkle fingers where, when someone says something that really moves me or I agree with or want to affirm, I waggle (twinkle) my fingers at them (think jazz hands). Direct responses can be indicated by pointing the index finger of each hand and alternately raising and lowering those fingers (from the wrist).

*Rationale* This creative non-verbal communication takes up less time- and audio-space than clapping. Very easy introduction to the idea that different communication tools have different outcomes. And somehow it feels really great when a lot of people twinkle at you :)

#### Commitment to Action

At the end of the session, everyone decides one thing they are going to do. Share it out loud to make a commitment in front of others. You can use this tool for individuals at any point you see fit in a session.

#### Retrospective

*Process*: At the end of a specified number of sessions, run a Retrospective.

How you do this tends to depend on how much time you have and how much trust you have built within the participants. One way is to give everyone three post it notes and on one they write something like likes, one something they did not like, and something they would recommend to change.

Another example is to use the 4 L's: What's something you...
- Loved
- Learned
- felt it Lacked
- Longed for


#### Letter to self

_Process_: Invite people to write a letter to their future self. You can encourage them to write something to remind them of today, to make a commitment to their future self

#### Check out

_Process_: If there is time at the end, end like you began and do a check out. You could ask: What are you leaving with? What was your key insight?

## 4 Element Invitation

Pods formed by a caller that puts the right efforts in pre-defining these 4 elements are more likely to have high engagement and ongoing momentum. Presenting these in a brief document attached to the invitation will help people see fit and act as a natural filter to attract the people your pod needs. You can use this template to help you describing your pod using these 4 elements. You can also refer to THIS for a real world example.

You might want to get everyone to collectively amend your document during your first call to help the group align around the 4 elements and make them evolve around a shared understanding that forms a glue between the group members.
