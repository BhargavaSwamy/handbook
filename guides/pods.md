# Growing our support in Pods

## What is a Pod?


Pods are small groups of people (typically 3 to 5) formed by members and contributors of Enspiral. These groups can support us to build relationships across the network – especially with those further from the center - supporting more people to be ‘seen’ and to experience mutual support and care.


## Forming a Pod

A pod is formed by inviting people to adhere to a porposal composed of an *intention* and *principles*. The proposal may also give insights on a specific *format* that the group will follow, as well as *rituals* they will use through their calls.

### The 4 elements

The following definitions clear up what is meant by the aformentioned terms:

- The **intention** clearly states the common intent bringing a group together (e.g. studying a topic together or going through a self-development methodology).

- **Principles** are the set of rules, protocols and values that define the culture of the pod. You might consider principles around context, meeting rhythm as well as facilitation and hosting duties.

- **Rituals** are practices that help boost the interactivity of your calls. It could be as simple as holding a minute of silence at the start of the call.
Some rituals call for forward preparation to concentrate even more connecting energy into the limited time of a call.

- A **Format** makes your pod progress through successive themed sessions. It might specify a set of rituals for each session as well as activities that participants do in-between calls.

Pod callers can refer to the [List of Rituals](#list-of-rituals) and the [List of Formats](#list-of-formats) for inspiration on what to propose to their group. The section [Embracing resilience](#embracing-resilience) highlights key *principles* relating to peoples' boundaries, as well as meeting cycles and cadence.


### The process

1. Write a proposal with an *intention* and *principles*. You can optionally add *rituals* and a *format* you'd like to follow.
1. Send your proposal to people with compatible timezones until your group reaches a size of 3 to 5 people
1. Schedule the call and sketch an agenda
1. Incorporate feedback into your initial proposal before and during your first call.


## Embracing resilience

There are key areas where *principles* might be specifically important for all groups:

- **naming your elders** - What’s the lineage that you are following? Who are you emulating or modelling after?
- **acknowledging boundaries** – What are you up for? And what are you not up for? Talk about your Norms and Boundaries. Eg, being respectful with each other, setting a confidentiality agreement, etc.
- **cadence** - How often are you meeting? Some pods do it every week for a while and then change to longer cadence, fortnightly or monthly. It is up to your pod members to decide. Having a regular time (eg, first Monday of the month) makes it significantly easier to get together. If you don't have a regular time to meet, dedicating a few minutes at the end of each meeting to schedule the next one, makes logistics easier and more effective.
- **presence** - Agree on the minimum number of participants you want to be present to go ahead with a meeting Do you want everyone to be present every time? Can you go ahead with a meeting if someone can’t make it?
- **cycles** - When do you stop? When do you reflect? Start with the end in mind or with a moment when you will stop and reflect (also see the *[Retrospective ritual](#list-of-rituals)*)

## List of Rituals

- **Retrospective** - Agree on a time to stop and reflect on how is the pod working for each member: What is working well? What can be better? What are we going to change?
- **Shared learning** - Share what you learn in your Retro with the network so we can all learn together. We will have shared learning prompts with the network every 3 months, and an open thread where everyone can post what have they learned from specific Formats and Rituals.
