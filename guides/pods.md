# Organising in Pods

## Becoming a caller

## Joining a pod

# The pod callers toolkit

In order to help create lively pods, members of the [pods working group]() have put together a list of *principles*, *rituals* and *resilience tips*. They are meant to inspire, though we invite you to challenge and alter them to better fit the needs of your specific group.

*Principles* are basic rules that define key aspects of the culture around which we meet.

*Rituals* and other *practices* can help boost the interactivity of your calls so that they feel much richer than a dull chat. Some of them call for forward preparation to concentrate even more connecting energy into the limited time of a call. 

*Resilience tips* help to deal with the unexpected. There may be unspoken tension arising in a pod that could compromise its perennity.
