# Enspiral Node Guidelines

These are the formal guidelines for creating and maintaining an [Enspiral Node](../agreements/nodes.md). [The board](../foundation/board.md) is responsible for setting and maintaining the guidelines, and following a formal advice process when changing them.

Coming soon - The board has not yet set the first iteration of the guidelines.
