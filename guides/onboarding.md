## Activation Programme

Activation Programme was an experiment launched in 2017 aimed to support new contributors to become quickly active in the community through a "learning by doing" process. It consists in completing a list of easy / intermediate / hard challenges that will help any new contributor know more about Enspiral processes, people and culture.

While the programme is not currently running, the challenges are still relevant for the newcommers to Enspiral.

  * write a blog post
  * create a loomio thread
