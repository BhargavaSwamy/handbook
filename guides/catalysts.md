# How Catalysts Work

We're governed by the [Catalyst Agreement](https://handbook.enspiral.com/catalyst_agreement.html)

We run 2 week sprints. We take turns hosting our ceremonies: planning, sync (catch up time), retro.

For demo, we make short videos to share our progress with the network. These arereported in the fortnightly network newsletter and published on [our Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/enspiral/videos).

We track all our work on [the Improvements board](https://waffle.io/enspiral/improvements?search=catalyst).

We try to take notes in all our meetings, and share them in the Slack channel #catalysts.

## What are we doing

Sensing community needs, initiating responses, handing them off wherever possible.

* Sense-making (maintaining context).
* We help [working groups](working_groups.md) to form.
* We remind people of the things they said they would do (e.g. fill in your quarterly venture update).
* We encourage people to contribute, e.g. by matching people to opportunities, or inviting individuals to contribute on specific tasks.
* We maintain our own internal rhythm, which everyone else can sync up with if its useful.
* We do things until we can delegate or automate them.


## TODO: share example of working group formation, e.g. the stewardship project
